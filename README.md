**Objective:**  
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract key business insights using Python libraries.

**Steps Taken:**

## Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded data using Pandas
- Cleaned null values and corrected data types
- Performed outlier detection using IQR and visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
- Created:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Distribution plots
  - Category-wise boxplots and bar charts
- Analyzed patterns and trends based on customer demographics and purchase behavior

## Insights Discovered:
- Age and income had strong correlation with purchase frequency
- Product A had the highest return rate
- Majority of purchases were made in urban Tier 1 cities

## Design & Visualization:
- Jupyter Notebook used for interactive analysis
- Plots styled with seaborn themes and annotations

**Tools Used:**
